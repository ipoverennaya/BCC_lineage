This repository contains code used in the paper "Motor nerves direct the development of the sympathetic nervous system" by Erickson et al.

To explore the possibility of how the motor neurons participate in signaling interactions with either neural crest, SCP, or sympathetic neurons, we analyzed publicly available single-cell transcriptomic datasets of motor neurons (from Amin et al, 2021) as well as the whole neural crest lineage including hub-state SCPs, boundary cap cells, satellite glia, and sympathetic neurons at various developmental stages (focusing on the cells represented at E12.5, from Kastriti, Faure, and Von Ahsen et al, 2022).

To study the derivatives of the boundary cap cells, we sequenced Egr2+ and Prss56+ cell lineages (stored in GEO under accession number GSE261748) and performed sing-cell analysis using python packages scanpy and scvelo.
